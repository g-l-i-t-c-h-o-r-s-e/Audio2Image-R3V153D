# Examples:
This one uses the GMIC Perspective filter; I also manually changed the dimensions to be 1000x7200 instead of 3324x3324 in this case.

Same as above but I used the GIMP Pixelize filter instead. <br>

# Tips
32bit is still a WIP. <br>
There is a more simplified version here, without a gui.<br>

I highly suggest getting GMIC for gimp, as it will add around 570+ new filters for you to glitch with. <br>
